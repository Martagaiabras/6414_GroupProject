Customer churn (or customer attrition) analysis is one of the vital measures for subscription-based business models such as telecom services, internet providers. This is more important in business sectors that have high competition. Companies can choose to increase engagement with customers that are expected to churn to retain them, which would lead the company to increase revenue.

Data: 

The IBM Business Analytics Community provides a fictional dataset of over 7000 customers for a telecom company that contains information about which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. The dataset also contains major demographic information for customers, along with Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index.

Dataset description (this includes detailed descriptions of each data type): https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113

Questions:
1.	What is the probability that a given customer will churn? (Logistic regression)
2.	What factors are the largest contributors to customer churn? (Linear regression)
3.	What customers should be targeted for additional engagement? (Based on churn probability and customer lifetime value)
4.	Do particular customer groups have a higher churn rate (payment method, senior citizen, contract type, etc)? (ANOVA)
