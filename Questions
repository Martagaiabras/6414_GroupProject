A) Model Selection
Is this the correct order for model selection:
  1. Build the full model, ridge regression model and variable selection models (lasso, stepwise and elastic net)
  2. Evaluate the model fit
  3. Make the necessary transformations 
  4. Compare the efficiency measures for the models that have a good fit
  
Do we remove outliers before doing any model selection/goodness of fit testing?
  
B) Imbalanced Data
While making a classification model (using logistic regression), how do we account for imbalance in our dataset - such that our model is not skewed towards the majority class?
- We have 5174 observations where customer churn is False, and only 1869 observations where customer churn in True. 

C) Goodness of Fit
Is there an equivalent to evaluating the Linearity assumption for Categorical variables?

D) What do we do if our models violate the assumptions and are not a good fit? Are the models still somewhat valuable or do we have to throw them out?
