A) Model Selection
Is this the correct order for model selection:
  1. Build the full model, ridge regression model and variable selection models (lasso, stepwise and elastic net)
  2. Evaluate the model fit
  3. Make the necessary transformations 
  4. Compare the efficiency measures for the models that have a good fit
